# 🚀 Hands-On: Python, PyTorch & TensorFlow Foundation

This project serves as a comprehensive quick-start guide to deep learning frameworks. It is designed to help developers (especially those transitioning from languages like Java) master core operations and understand the syntactic differences between **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**.

## 📌 Project Highlights

* **Fundamental Concepts**: Covers everything from advanced Python syntax (List Comprehension, Classes) to core data processing with NumPy.
* **Dual-Framework Comparison**: Implements the same computational logic side-by-side in both PyTorch and TensorFlow.
* **Tensor Manipulation**: Practical exercises on tensor creation, reshaping, dimensional operations, and arithmetic.
* **Automatic Differentiation (Autograd)**: A clear demonstration of gradient computation—the backbone of deep learning.
